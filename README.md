A community forum for programmers that supports basic functions such as registration, login, profile setting, direct message, post, comment, like and follow modules with efficient file storage in AWS S3.
- Utilized Redis HyperLogLog to estimate the count of unique visitors (UV) and Bitmaps to track the Daily Active User (DAU).
- Implemented role-based access control with Spring Security and used Elasticsearch for global search functionality, incorporating keyword highlighting to enhance user search experience.
- Developed a hot posts ranking feature using a multi-level caching strategy with Caffeine as the local cache and Redis for distributed cache, preventing cache avalanche issues and improving the websiteâ€™s query performance by 19.7 times (from 9.5 QPS to 186.8 QPS).
- Integrated Kafka to manage system notifications for comments, likes, follows, and asynchronously relay new posts to the Elasticsearch server, encapsulating these processes within events for a robust message system.
